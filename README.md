# Java-Snake-Game
A Java Snake Game is a simple 2D game where a snake moves to eat randomly placed food, growing longer with each bite. Built using Java Swing, it uses a Timer for movement, KeyListener for controls, and collision checks to end the game when the snake hits a wall or itself, making it a fun beginner GUI project.
